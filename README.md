# Deep_Learning_for_Natural_Language_Processing

This repository is dedicated to the algorithms and codes taught in the following book:

"Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing" , Jason Brownlee.

In some parts of this repository, I have used exactly the codes and datasets mentioned in the book, but in some chapters, a different dataset has been used.
The topics discussed in this book are as follows:

### 1. Foundations:
This chapter includes the definition of natural language, its challenges, and general explanations of natural language processing and deep learning. In the other part of this chapter, deep learning models for solving natural language problems have been explained.
The notebook related to this section has developed deep learning models with Keras and has used exactly the codes and datasets of the book.

### 2. Data Preparation:
This chapter covers data cleaning and prepare text using NLTK, scikit-learn and Keras libraries.
The notebooks related to this section also used exactly the codes and data set of the book.

### 3. Bag-of-Words:
This chapter includes teaching the Bag-of-words model and using it for sentiment analysis.
Notebooks in this section have used sentiment analysis to detect phishing emails. For this purpose, one of Kaggle's data sets was used at the address below.

### 4. Word Embeddings:
This chapter includes the training of word Embedding model and its development using Gensim. Also, the method of learning and loading word Embedding in keras has been taught in this section.
The notebooks related to this section also used exactly the codes and data set of the book.

### 5. Text Classification
This chapter includes the training of neural models for data classification, which are used in two ways for sentiment analysis.
The notebooks related to this section have used the Kaggle data set mentioned in section 3.

### 6. Neural Language Modeling
This chapter includes the development of character-base and Word-Based Neural Language Model and models for text generation.
Notebooks in this section have used for analysis and generate poems. For this purpose, one of Kaggle's data sets was used at the address below.
